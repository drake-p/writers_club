How to access and change the files on the school's server:

1. Connect to VPN server at https://vpn.student.gvsu.edu/ using login: writers and pw: pont8yar
2. Choose Start connection
3. Now, ftp into the server using the following:
Host: ftp://www2.gvsu.edu/
Login: writers
PW: pont8yar

That should allow you to access all the files on the club's drive, and then it's business as usual.
